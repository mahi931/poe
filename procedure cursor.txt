Explanation:

Cursor Declaration:

A cursor named GPA_Cursor is declared to iterate over the Students table.
The cursor fetches StudentID, Name, and GPA columns for each row.
Cursor Loop:

The FETCH NEXT statement fetches the next row from the cursor.
The WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0 loop continues as long as there are more rows to process.
Conditional Evaluation:

Inside the loop, an IF condition checks the GPA value:
If GPA is less than 3.0, a message is printed indicating a low GPA.
Otherwise, a message is printed indicating a satisfactory GPA.
Cursor Closing:

The CLOSE statement closes the cursor.
The DEALLOCATE statement deallocates the cursor resources.
To execute this procedure:

SQL
EXEC EvaluateStudentGPAs;
