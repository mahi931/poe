Creating the Trigger:

SQL
CREATE TRIGGER DeleteScholarshipOnGPADrop
ON Students
AFTER UPDATE
AS
BEGIN
    DECLARE @StudentID INT;
    
    SELECT @StudentID = inserted.StudentID
    FROM inserted
    WHERE inserted.GPA < 3.0;

    IF @StudentID IS NOT NULL
        DELETE FROM Scholarships
        WHERE StudentID = @StudentID;
END;
Use code with caution.

Explanation:

Trigger Creation:

We create an AFTER UPDATE trigger on the Students table. This means the trigger will fire after any update operation on the Students table.
Identifying the Affected Student:

The inserted table contains the new values of the updated row.
We select the StudentID of the updated row and store it in the @StudentID variable.
Deleting Scholarships (if necessary):

If the @StudentID is not NULL (meaning the GPA has dropped below 3.0), we delete any corresponding scholarships from the Scholarships table using the DELETE statement.
How it Works:

A student's GPA is updated.
The trigger fires.
The trigger checks if the new GPA is below 3.0.
If it is, the trigger deletes any scholarships associated with that student.
Important Note:

Ensure that you have appropriate indexes on the StudentID column in both tables to optimize the performance of the trigger.
Consider additional error handling and logging mechanisms to improve the robustness of the trigger.
Test the trigger thoroughly to ensure it works as expected under various scenarios.
By implementing this trigger, you can automatically maintain the integrity of the Scholarships table based on changes in student GPAs.
