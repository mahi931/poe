Executing the Queries:

1] Find the average price of non-electric cars:

SQL
SELECT AVG(price) AS avg_price_non_electric
FROM Cars
WHERE is_electric = 0;
Use code with caution.

Explanation:

SELECT AVG(price) AS avg_price_non_electric calculates the average price of non-electric cars and gives an alias to the result column.
FROM Cars specifies the table to query.
WHERE is_electric = 0 filters the rows where the is_electric column is 0 (non-electric cars).

2] Find the car models with the highest average price for each car dealer:

SQL
SELECT dealer_name, MAX(avg_price) AS highest_avg_price
FROM (
    SELECT dealer_name, AVG(price) AS avg_price
    FROM Cars
    INNER JOIN CarDealers ON Cars.dealer_id = CarDealers.dealer_id
    GROUP BY dealer_name
) AS AvgPricesPerDealer;
Use code with caution.

Explanation:

The inner query:

INNER JOIN joins the Cars and CarDealers tables based on the dealer_id column.
GROUP BY dealer_name groups the results by dealer_name.
AVG(price) AS avg_price calculates the average price for each dealer.
The outer query:

MAX(avg_price) AS highest_avg_price finds the maximum average price for each dealer.
SELECT dealer_name, MAX(avg_price) AS highest_avg_price selects the dealer_name and the maximum average price.

3]Find the total number of electric and non-electric cars:

SQL
SELECT 
    SUM(CASE WHEN is_electric = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS total_electric_cars,
    SUM(CASE WHEN is_electric = 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS total_non_electric_cars
FROM Cars;
Use code with caution.

Explanation:

The CASE WHEN expressions count the number of electric and non-electric cars.
SUM adds up the counts.

4]Select all car if they are in before 2024 and also show their electric status, along with their corresponding dealer city and delivery time:

SQL
SELECT Cars.make, Cars.model, Cars.year, Cars.is_electric, CarDealers.city, CarDealers.delivery_time_days
FROM Cars
INNER JOIN CarDealers ON Cars.dealer_id = CarDealers.dealer_id
WHERE Cars.year < 2024;
Use code with caution.

Explanation:

INNER JOIN joins the Cars and CarDealers tables based on the dealer_id column.
WHERE Cars.year < 2024 filters the rows where the year is less than 2024.
SELECT Cars.make, Cars.model, Cars.year, Cars.is_electric, CarDealers.city, CarDealers.delivery_time_days selects the specified columns from the joined tables.

5]Delete all non-electric cars where the mileage is less than 30,000:

SQL
DELETE FROM Cars
WHERE is_electric = 0 AND mileage < 30000;
Use code with caution.

Explanation:

DELETE FROM Cars deletes rows from the Cars table.
WHERE is_electric = 0 AND mileage < 30000 filters the rows to be deleted.
